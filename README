The maze.png file was also retrieved from these series

The Serial data by Arduino is retrieved from Arduino 1.8.9 software
The connection guide and code for Arduino was retrieved from the youtube video
'How to connect and use an Analog Joystick with an Arduino - Tutorial' by Brainy-Bits
And then adjusted to fit our needs.
The code for reading the Arduino serial data in python was constructed using the information on the web page:

The the speech recognition code is based on the information in the youtube video 'Speech Recognition using Python'
By Get Set Python. Retrieved from: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_WbsFrPUCk
